This project intends to develop a real-time audio-to-text converter utilizing Whisper AI, OpenAI's cutting-edge speech recognition engine. This program, which uses PyAudio to capture and rapidly transcribe live audio from a microphone, may be used for live transcription, real-time captioning, and voice-controlled apps. Whisper AI provides great accuracy and performance when translating spoken words to text, making it a significant asset for improving accessibility and user engagement in a variety of scenarios.
